    <h3>What is GlobalSearch?</h3>
    <p>
      GlobalSearch is a multistart framework for global optimization that uses scatter search and local NLP solvers
      to find the likely global minimum of a function. It is written in Rust and has Python bindings.
    </p>

    <h3>Python or Rust?</h3>
    <p>
      GlobalSearch can be used with either Rust or Python. The Rust version is the main version and
      is the most up-to-date. The Python version is a wrapper around the Rust version, it is not as
      feature-complete and has some limitations.
    </p>
  </div>

    <h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
    <p>
      You can contribute to GlobalSearch-rs by submitting bug reports, feature requests, or by
      contributing code. Check out the <a href="/contributing">Contributing</a> page for more
      information.

:::note[Tip!]

Since GlobalSearch can be used using either Rust or Python, we have different documentation for each
language. If you are a Rust user, you can check the Rust documentation that is usually marked with a
crab emoji (ü¶Ä). If you are a Python user, you can check the Python documentation, which is marked
with a snake emoji (üêç).

General documentation that is not specific to any language will not have any emoji.
